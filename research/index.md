Our research group conducts multidisciplinary research on large cohorts and registries to generate new methods and knowledge for the understanding of metabolic health during pregnancy and early childhood. 

- *Pregnancy health* We study metabolic health during pregnancy using omics in large cohort studies. We contribute to meta-analyses on health indicators during pregnancy including placental and fetal weight, pregnancy duration, or gestational diabetes. We recently received support from the European Reasearch Council to study whether symptoms in early pregnancy holds early warning signs for the health of mother and child.
- *Childhood diabetes* We study the different presentations of diabetes in children, to better understand the development of the disease and help clinicians tailor treatment strategies to the metabolic trajectories of children.
- *Childhood growth* We study the growth of children, focusing on the consequences of health during pregnancy. We use genetic epidemiology techniques to understand the mechanisms sustaining the growth of children and whether some children show early signs of metabolic imbalance in their growth trajectory.

In addition, our group conducts method development in the field of medical data science. We also contribute to the development of resources for the handling of biodata in the [Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry](https://www.oslodiabetes.no/childhood) and the [Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)](https://www.fhi.no/en/ch/studies/moba).
