Our research group establishes both new knowledge and methods. Our flagship projects include:
- _Bioinformatics for Proteogenomics - looking up the answer in the back of the book_, a project funded by a starting grant from the [Norwegian Research Council](forskningsradet.no)
- _Temporary inconvenience or early warning signs? A new take on maternal symptoms in early pregnancy and their consequences. AuditeMatrem_, a project funded by a consolidator grant from the [European Research Council](erc.europa.eu)
