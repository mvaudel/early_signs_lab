## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research group identifies early warning signs for health trajectories that increase the risk of disease. We focus mainly on metabolic health during pregnancy and early childhood using multidisciplinary research on large cohorts and registries.

Our main research areas include:
- _Pregnancy health_ where we study how health during pregnancy influences later health of mother and child.
- _Childhood diabetes_ where we study the health trajectories of children with different forms of diabetes.
- _Childhood growth_ where we study the growth trajectories of children.

In addition, we develop methods, tools and pipeline for _genomics_, _proteomics_ and their combination in the context of large cohort studies.
