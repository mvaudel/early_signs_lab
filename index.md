# Early signs

To prevent diseases timing is key, our research team is looking for early signs of pathogenic health trajectories.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research group researches early warning signs for health trajectories that increase the risk of disease. We focus mainly on metabolic health during pregnancy and early childhood using multidisciplinary research on large cohorts and registries.

Our research group is leading international multidisciplinary research projects. Our flagship projects include:
- [AuditeMatrem](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101171420), a project funded by the European Research Council to find how symptoms in early pregnancy can inform on future health for the mother and child.
- [PRECIS-DIA](https://mohnfoundation.no/en/https-mohnfoundation-no-en-thematic-initiatives-womens-health/diabetes-precision-medicine), a project funded by the Trond Mohn Foundation to improve the tailoring of diabetes care to individual patient trajectories.
- [Proteogenomics bioinformatics](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/301178), a project funded by the Norwegian Research Council to improve the joint interpretation of genomic and proteomic data to better track metabolic trajectories of children with diabetes.
