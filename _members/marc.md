After completing engineering studies in France, I completed a PhD in proteomics bioinformatics shared between the groups of Prof. Dr. Albert Sickmann at [ISAS](isas.de) and of Prof. Lennart Martens at the [Ghent university](ugent.be). Then I joined the [University of Bergen](uib.no) for a post-doc and established my research group there. We conduct multidisciplinary research on large cohorts and registries to generate new methods and knowledge for the understanding of metabolic health during pregnancy and early childhood. We are located at the Children and Youth Clinic of the Haukeland University hospital in Bergen Norway, affiliated to the University of Bergen, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the Computational Biology Unit.
